I am a Professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at the Beijing Institute of Technology . I was formerly a graduate student at the Software Engineering Institute ,Peking University . I defended my PhD thesis in June 2008.

My research interests include deep learning based software engineering, in particular: deep learning based program generation; software refactoring; automatic program repair; software quality; machine learning based code complete; automatic construction of software engineering datasets. My work is funded in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the National Key Research and Development Program of China.

I am a recipient of the RE'2021 best research paper award (2021), IET Software Premium Award (2018), New Century Excellent Talents in University (2013), and Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher (2013). I am also a distinguished member of China Computer Federation (中国计算机学会杰出会员)

I am always looking for self-motivated students to work with me . Contact me by eMail if you are interested in deep learning ,software engineering ,natural language processing , or data mining .
